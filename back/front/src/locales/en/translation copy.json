    "chart_content": "Major Cards\n\nMeaning:\nMajor Arcana cards represent significant influence. The total number of Major Arcana cards is approximately 0.4 times the total number of Minor Arcana cards. Statistically, it tends to be less, but typically around 25-30% is average (varies depending on the individual and situation).If Major Arcana cards appear relatively more than the amount that typically comes out(25-30%), they indicate that certain situations or emotions are important and have a 'significant impact', primarily in specific categories (such as subject matter or question topic). This can mean a greater energy than Minor Arcana cards. For example, in the category of love, it signifies that regardless of whether the cards are positive or negative, they are deeply felt emotionally. It can also indicate that there is a major turning point in one's current life or that personal growth is anticipated.\n\nMinor Cards\n\nMeaning:\nMinor Arcana cards represent everyday aspects and occurrences. Each card expresses ordinary situations, emotions, states, and more.\nWhen Minor Arcana cards appear frequently in tarot readings, it indicates that certain situations or emotions are not important or have little influence, primarily in specific categories. This may imply that there are many relatively unimportant events occurring or that there are not strong emotional reactions. It can also suggest that everyday and less important events are likely to affect the current situation.\n\nMeaning of Elements:\nWands:\nSymbolizing the element of fire, they represent action, active energy, passion, creativity, and the future.\n\nCups:\nSymbolizing the element of water, they represent emotions and mental aspects.\n\nSwords:\nSymbolizing the element of air, they represent thoughts, decisions, challenges, and difficulties.\n\nPentacles:\nSymbolizing the element of earth, they represent material aspects, financial stability, occupation, results, and possibilities for realization.\n\nWhen a Specific Element Appears Frequently:\nPay attention to the characteristics and domains of the corresponding element. For example, if Wand cards appear frequently, it indicates a strong fire energy, suggesting that new energy and creativity may play an important role. Additionally, it can be interpreted as keywords related to Wands, such as the will or ability to actuate actions.\n\nWhen Multiple Elements Appear Balanced:\nThere may be a more balanced situation or influences from various aspects.\n\nWhen a Specific Element is Lacking:\nYou may need to complement the characteristics of the missing element or pay attention to it.",
    "principle_content": "In the 1930s, psychiatrist and psychologist Carl Gustav Jung stated that the collective unconscious, shared by all of humanity, could be read through Tarot cards. In other words, the collective unconscious is a common trait shared by humanity, interconnected in the deep realms of the unconscious. Jung also explained this through the 'principle of synchronicity,' which means that events that seem to occur simultaneously by chance are actually related, occurring at the same time or with a brief time difference due to the interaction of energies. Therefore, the moment of drawing Tarot cards involves an exchange of unconscious energies, and as the energy waves increase, the cards are drawn. Hence, when choosing Tarot cards, whether drawn by someone else or without explicitly mentioning names, you can focus on and choose cards with the desired question in mind. And, Tarot cards, based on the energy of the moment when drawn after asking a question, yield results. Therefore, keep in mind that a person's mood can change at any time when utilizing them. If you find the answer to be ambiguous, it can be a good idea to draw the cards 2 or 3 times. While a remedy can be beneficial for health, excessive use can transform it into poison, so it's advisable to utilize it within limits that safeguard your mental well-being."
