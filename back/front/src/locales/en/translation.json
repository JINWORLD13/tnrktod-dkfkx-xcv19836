    "chart_content": "A. Major Cards\n\nMeaning:\nMajor cards represent important themes in life and significant influences.\nThe total number of Major cards (22 cards) corresponds to approximately 39% of the total number of Minor cards (56 cards). Therefore, statistically, the probability of drawing Major cards is lower. Generally, they appear around 25-30%, but this can vary depending on the individual and situation. When Major cards appear more frequently than this ratio, it carries the following meanings:\n1. Important situations or emotions are at play in the relevant category (question subject, question entity, etc.).\n2. The current situation indicates an 'influential' important period.\n3. They may contain more powerful energy or messages than Minor cards.\nFor example, if many Major cards appear in a specific category like love, it could mean that the current relationship is at an important turning point in life or experiencing deep emotional experiences. It could also indicate that your current life is at a major turning point or that important opportunities for personal growth are approaching.\n\n~\n\nB. Minor Cards\nMeaning:\nMinor cards represent everyday aspects and specific events. Each card expresses daily situations, emotions, and states in more detail.\nWhen many Minor cards appear in a tarot reading, it may have the following meanings:\n1. The current situation is progressing routinely without dramatic changes.\n2. It focuses mainly on daily problems and decisions by category.\n3. Generally tends to indicate everyday situations or gradual changes rather than major changes.\nThis can also suggest that small daily choices can accumulate to create big changes over time.\n\n~\n\nC.

When Specific Elements Appear Frequently:\nAttention should be paid to the characteristics and domains of the corresponding element. For example, when many Wands (Fire) cards appear, it means that the energy of passion, creativity, and action is strongly at work. This might be a suitable time for new beginnings or projects, and it's important to utilize this energy constructively.\n\n~\n\nE. When Multiple Elements Appear in Balance:\nThis indicates that the current situation is receiving balanced influences from various aspects. There is a high possibility that different areas of life are working harmoniously.\n\n~\n\nF. When Specific Elements are Lacking:\nThere may be a need to consciously complement or develop the characteristics of the lacking element. For example, if few Water (Cups) cards appear, there might be a need to pay more attention to emotional aspects or relationships.",
    "principle_content": "Psychiatrist and psychologist Carl Gustav Jung believed that the realm of collective unconscious shared by humanity could be understood through Tarot cards. According to his theory, the collective unconscious is a characteristic common to all humanity, and we are connected to each other in the deep realm of the unconscious. Based on this perspective, Jung developed the 'principle of synchronicity.' This means that events that occur simultaneously by chance are actually deeply related through unconscious connections. He applied this principle to Tarot cards, explaining that at the moment of choosing a card, a special connection is formed between the questioner's unconscious and the card. Following this principle, meaningful results can be obtained whether you draw the cards directly, have someone else draw them for you, or even concentrate and choose while only thinking about the question without mentioning your name. It's important to note that Tarot cards show results based on the energy at the moment of questioning. Since human emotions and situations can continuously change, this should be kept in mind during interpretation. If the answer seems ambiguous, it may be helpful to check additional cards 2-3 times. However, excessive dependence can have a negative impact on mental health, so it should be used within appropriate limits.",
